						<h1>GOAL 13- CLIMATE ACTION</h1>
						<h3>
							Hold on tight because climate change is a big deal,
							touching every corner of our planet. We're not fully
							ready for the challenges it brings.
						</h3>
						<p>
							Humans are behind this, and it's seriously
							threatening life on Earth. The way we're pumping out
							greenhouse gases is making climate change happen way
							faster than expected. Brace yourself for extreme
							weather and rising seas. If we don't act now, the
							progress we've made over the years will crumble.
							Massive migrations, instability, and wars could
							become our reality. To keep global warming in check,
							we need to slash emissions by almost half by 2030.
							Right now, we're way off course. It's time for
							serious action and more than just plans and
							promises. We need big ideas that cover whole
							economies. Let's move towards development that can
							handle climate challenges, with a clear path to zero
							emissions. Quick measures are a must to dodge a
							disaster and create a lasting future for all. Join
							the movement!
						</p>
						<h2>Why is this all important?</h2>
						<p>
							Our planet is facing a serious problem called
							climate change. It's happening because of things we
							do, like driving cars and using factories that
							release heat into the air. This makes the Earth too
							warm, causing problems like floods and storms. We
							will because of this feel the effects, no matter
							where we live, If we don't do something about it,
							things will get even worse. We're already seeing
							changes in weather, and it's affecting our health,
							food, and homes.

							<h2>We need to work harder</h2>
							<p>
								Climate change is a big problem for our Earth.
								It happens because people use things like cars
								and factories that make the Earth too warm. This
								warming causes many issues like floods and
								storms. If we don't act, the cost will be much
								higher. So, we need to work hard to keep our
								promise and invest in a safer, better future for
								everyone.
							</p>
							<h2>6 easy stepts to take climate action:</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>Turn off lights when not needed.</li>
								<li>Sort your trash for recycling.</li>
								<li>Use both sides of paper.</li>
								<li>Pick up trash when you see it.</li>
								<li>
									Use your legs instead of a car or bike more!
								</li>
								<li>Plant a small flower in your backyard.</li>
